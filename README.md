# Learning Python

Welcome to the **Learning Python** repository. This project collects Python programs I created both for personal study and practical purposes.

## Purpose of the Repository
This repository was created to document my learning journey and share tools and ideas that might also be useful to others. The programs included range from practical, structured applications to small experimental projects designed to explore and reinforce programming concepts.

## Repository Structure
Each program in the repository is organized in a separate directory. Each directory includes:

- **Source code**: written in Python, with comments to facilitate understanding.
- **An associated README file**: describing the project's contents, main functionalities, and, when necessary, execution instructions.

## Repository Contents
The projects included can be classified into two main categories:

1. **Useful Programs**
   - Practical applications designed to solve real-world problems or simplify specific tasks.

2. **Experimental Projects**
   - Scripts and programs created to test theoretical concepts or explore new Python libraries and functionalities.

## How to Use the Contents
1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AstroTeo99/learning_python.git
   ```
2. **Run the Programs**
   Each project includes a README.md file with detailed execution instructions.

## Contributions
Although this repository is primarily dedicated to my learning, suggestions, corrections, or collaborations are always welcome. If you have ideas or feedback, feel free to open an **Issue** or create a **Pull Request**.
